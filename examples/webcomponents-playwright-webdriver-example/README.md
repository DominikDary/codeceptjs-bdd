## Applitools

Applitools is integrated thru the helper defined [here](https://codecept.io/visual/#using-applitools). In order to enabled Applitools for this example repo, provide the applitools key thru env variable as shown below, or add the KEY to your `codecept.dev.env` file,

```
APPLITOOLS_API_KEY=<your-key>
APPLITOOLS_SERVER_URL=<your-enterprise-server-url> // if your Applitools is enterprise server

```

#### Example Test Run

Uncomment the line `(I as any).eyeCheck('helloBinding')` in `hello-binding.spec.ts` file

##### Run on WebDriver

```
```

Please note: at this time the helper is only supported for Webdriver. Playwright will be enabled soon!
