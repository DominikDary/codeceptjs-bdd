```

### üìã Sauce Labs Dashboard

---

Dashboard is the great way group your scenarios/regression suites on Sauce platform. The Sauce Dashboard is the first page you'll see when you log into the Sauce Labs web interface. Each link on Dashboard contains group of tests ran for the particular _build_.

**Codeceptjs-BDD will automatically create an Unique dashboard for every tests run.**

**Can I Customize my Dashboard Title?**
Yes, you can do that too by by providing `SAUCE_BUILD` environment variable. This is sometimes very helpful to view how many and what tests ran for which release build.

Below command will create unique dashboard on sauce with title **release-1.0-{random-unique-number}**

```bash
    SAUCE_BUILD=release-1.0 yarn acceptance --profile sauce:chrome
```
