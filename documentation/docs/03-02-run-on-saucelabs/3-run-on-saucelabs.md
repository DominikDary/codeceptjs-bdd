### ‚ö°Ô∏è Sauce Labs

Codeceptjs-BDD framework integrates the cloud based platform [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com) to execute scenarios on **900+** Desktop/Mobile browses, OS & Devices combinations, providing Greater Scenarios Execution Coverage.

#### \*\* Prerequisites

1. In order to run on Sauce Labs, you should have an account with Sauce Labs.

2. During Codeceptjs-BDD setup through CLI, you should have provided your Sauce Username and Sauce Access Key in order to start running your tests on Sauce Labs.
3. You must export **SAUCE_USERNAME** and **SAUCE_KEY** environmental variables as shown below,

**Recommendation:** Export these enviornment variable through your ZSH or BASH profile.

```bash
   export SAUCE_USERNAME=<your_sauce_username>
    export SAUCE_KEY=<your_sauce_accesskey>
```

Once you provide your Sauce username and access-
key during [quick setup](/01-getting-started/1-quick-start/), Codeceptjs-BDD will do the rest of the job for you, and integrates all required libraries, plugins and helpers to get started.

### üìã Sauce Labs Dashboard

---

Dashboard is the great way group your scenarios/regression suites on Sauce platform. The Sauce Dashboard is the first page you'll see when you log into the Sauce Labs web interface. Each link on Dashboard contains group of tests ran for the particular _build_.

**Codeceptjs-BDD will automatically create an Unique dashboard for every tests run.**

**Can I Customize my Dashboard Title?**
Yes, you can do that too by by providing `SAUCE_BUILD` environment variable. This is sometimes very helpful to view how many and what tests ran for which release build.

Below command will create unique dashboard on sauce with title **release-1.0-{random-unique-number}**

```bash
    SAUCE_BUILD=release-1.0 yarn acceptance --profile sauce:chrome
```
